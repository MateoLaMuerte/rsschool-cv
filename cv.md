I started learning JavaScript because of popularity of programming. I want to explore different things and programming one of them. As far as I'll be interested in it I will improve my skills.

`function Fibonacci(n) {

  let arr = [0, 1];
  
  let sum;
  
  if (n === 1) {
  
    return 0;
    
  }
  
  else if (n === 2) {
  
    return 1;
    
  }
  
  else {
  
  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
  
    sum = arr[i - 2] + arr[i - 1];
    
    arr.push(sum);
    
  }
  
    }
    
  return arr[n - 1];
  
}`
